# Web_Scraping(Beautiful Soup)
Web scraping is a process of extracting data from websites using a program (e.g. Python). This involves sending HTTP requests to a website's server, downloading the HTML content of the web page, and then parsing that data to extract the information you need. The extracted data can then be stored in a database or spreadsheet for further analysis. Python has several libraries (e.g. BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) that make web scraping easy and efficient.
